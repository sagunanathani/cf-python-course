Exercise 1.2 — Practice Task 2: Tuples
Overview

In this practice task, I worked with Python tuples inside an IPython shell.
The goal of the task was to store world population data, slice it, and analyze values using Python’s built-in functions.

Steps Completed

1. Created a tuple named total_population
   This tuple contains world population values from 2008 to 2020.

2. Performed tuple slicing
   I extracted every third data point from the tuple using:

sliced_total_population = total_population[0::3]

3. Found the maximum value
   I used:

max_value = max(sliced_total_population)

This returned the largest population value in the sliced tuple.
