Recipe App – Data Structure Task (Practice Task 6)

This task focuses on selecting appropriate data types and structures for storing recipes.
Each recipe contains a name (string), cooking time (integer), and ingredients (list of strings). A dictionary was chosen to represent each recipe because dictionaries allow clear labeling of attributes using key-value pairs, which makes the data organized, descriptive, and easy to modify.

For the outer structure all_recipes, a list was chosen because it is sequential, ordered, and easily expandable. This allows storing multiple recipe dictionaries and modifying, adding, or removing recipes as the application grows.

The task includes creating five recipe dictionaries, adding them to all_recipes, and printing the ingredients of each recipe individually.
