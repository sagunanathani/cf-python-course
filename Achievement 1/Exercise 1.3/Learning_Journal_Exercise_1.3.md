🧪 Learning Journal – Exercise 1.3
🗓️ Date: 18 November 2025

🧠 What I Learned
In this exercise, I practiced using:

- Functions to modularize input logic (take_recipe()).
- Lists and dictionaries to store and manage recipe data.
- Loops to process multiple recipes and ingredients.
- Conditional logic to calculate recipe difficulty based on cooking time and number of ingredients.

I also reinforced my understanding of:

- How to check for duplicates using if item not in list.
- How to sort and display data cleanly.
- How to structure a Python script for user interaction.

🛠️ What I Built

- A script that collects multiple recipes from the user.
- Automatically calculates and displays difficulty levels.
- Tracks all unique ingredients and displays them alphabetically.

📸 Screenshots Captured

- Step 1: User input for number of recipes.
- Step 2: Recipe entry.
- Step 3: Recipe display with difficulty.
- Step 4: Alphabetical list of all ingredients.

🚀 Next Steps

- Refactor the script to allow saving recipes to a file.
- Add input validation (e.g., check for numeric cooking time).
- Explore using classes for recipe objects.
