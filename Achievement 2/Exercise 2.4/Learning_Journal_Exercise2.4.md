# 🧠 Learning Journal – Exercise 2.4: Custom Welcome Page

## 📌 Overview

In this exercise, I created a custom welcome page for my Django Recipe App.  
This involved defining a view, designing an HTML template, mapping the view to the root URL, and verifying the output in the browser.

---

## 🛠️ What I Did

- Defined a `home` view in `recipes/views.py` using `render()`.
- Created a `templates/recipes/recipes_home.html` file with custom HTML and CSS.
- Designed the page with a header, navigation bar, welcome message, and footer.
- Mapped the view to the root URL using `recipes/urls.py` and `recipe_project/urls.py`.
- Ran the server and verified the homepage at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
- Took a screenshot of the homepage and saved it as `welcome.jpg`.
- Uploaded the screenshot and journal to the `Exercise 2.4` folder in my Achievement 2 repo.

## ✅ What I Learned

- How to create and connect views and templates in Django.
- How to structure template folders correctly (`templates/<app>/<template>.html`).
- How to map views to URLs using `include()` and `urlpatterns`.
- How to design a visually appealing homepage using HTML and inline CSS.
- How to document and organize exercise deliverables for GitHub submission.

## 💬 Reflection

This task helped me understand how Django renders templates and connects views to URLs.  
Designing the homepage gave me a chance to apply HTML creatively and structure my app for future expansion.  
I now feel confident creating custom views and templates, and I understand how Django’s routing system works.  
This exercise also reinforced the importance of clean documentation and visual evidence for tutor review.
